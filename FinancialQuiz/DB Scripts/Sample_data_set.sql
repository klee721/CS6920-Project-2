Update questions set explanation = 'In general, investing in a stock mutual fund is less risky than investing in a single stock because mutual funds offer a way to diversify. Diversification means spreading your risk by spreading your investments. With a single stock, all your eggs are in one basket. If the price falls when you sell, you lose money. With a mutual fund that invests in the stocks of dozens (or even hundreds) of companies, you lower the chances that a price decline for any single stock will impact your return. Diversification generally may result in a more consistent performance in different market conditions.' where description = 'Buying a single company''s stock usually provides a safer return than a stock mutual fund.';
Update questions set explanation = 'The S&P 500 (SPX), Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) and Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) are the world''s largest indices based on the market capitalization of their constituents.

Update questions set explanation = 'The reason you have less is inflation. Inflation is the rate at which the price of goods and services rises. If the annual inflation rate is 2 percent but the savings account only earns 1 percent, the cost of goods and services has outpaced the buying power of the money in the savings account that year. Put another way, your buying power has not kept up with inflation.' where description = 'Imagine that the interest rate on your savings account is 1 percent a year and inflation is 2 percent a year. After one year, would the money in the account buy more than it does today, exactly the same or less than today?';
Update questions set explanation = 'When interest rates rise, bond prices fall. And when interest rates fall, bond prices rise. This is because as interest rates go up, newer bonds come to market paying higher interest yields than older bonds already in the hands of investors, making the older bonds worth less.' where description = 'If you purchase a bond and interest rates rise, what will happen to the price of the bond?';

Update questions set explanation = 'If someone did not understand how compound interest operates, they might conclude that borrowing at 20 percent per year would lead to doubling in five years. However, someone who knew about interest on interest would understand that the answer would be somewhat less than five years. Further, someone who knows the ''rule of 72'' heuristic would know that it would be about 3.6 years, which makes the correct answer "2 to 4 years." In finance, the rule of 72 is a method for estimating an investment''s doubling time. The rule number (i.e., 72) is divided by the interest percentage per period to obtain the approximate number of periods (usually years) required for doubling. The other responses reflect a misunderstanding of the concept of interest accrual.' where description = 'Suppose you owe $1,000 on a loan and the interest rate you are charged is 20% per year compounded annually.

Update questions set explanation = 'Assuming the same interest rate for both loans, you will pay less in interest over the life of a 15-year loan than you would with a 30-year loan because you repay the principal at a faster rate. This also explains why the monthly payment for a 15-year loan is higher. Let’s say you get a 30-year mortgage at 6 percent on a $150,000 home. You will pay $899 a month in principal and interest charges. Over 30 years, you will pay $173,757 in interest alone. But a 15-year mortgage at the same rate will cost you less. You will pay $1,266 each month but only $77,841 in total interest—nearly $100,000 less.' where description = ' A 15-year mortgage typically requires higher monthly payments than a 30-year mortgage but the total interest over the life of the loan will be less.';

Update questions set explanation = 'Points are fees you pay the lender for the loan. One point equals 1% of the loan amount. Points usually are paid in cash at closing.

Update questions set explanation = 'You''ll have more than $102 at the end of five years because your interest will compound over time. In other words, you earn interest on the money you save and on the interest your savings earned in prior years. Here’s how the math works. A savings account with $100 and a 2 percent annual interest rate would earn $2 in interest for an ending balance of $102 by the end of the first year. Applying the same 2 percent interest rate, the $102 would earn $2.04 in the second year for an ending balance of $104.04 at the end of that year. Continuing in this same pattern, the savings account would grow to $110.41 by the end of the fifth year.' where description = 'Suppose you have $100 in a savings account earning 2 percent interest a year.

Update questions set explanation = 'Unit pricing is a tool for comparing prices. While the package price tells you how much you pay for a food item, the unit price tells you the price of each unit in a package. A unit can be an ounce, a pound, a quart, a square foot, or an individual piece in a package. For example, the unit price shows you the cost of each ounce in a can of soup. The package price just tells you the price of the whole can. Unit pricing helps you compare costs of different brands and various sizes without doing arithmetic. But remember, compare only similar items.' where description = 'By using unit pricing at the grocery store, you can easily compare the cost of any brand and any package size.';

Unless your engine is knocking, buying higher octane gasoline is a waste of money. Premium gas costs 15 cents to 20 cents more a gallon than regular. That can add up to $100 or more a year in extra costs. Studies indicate that altogether, drivers may be spending hundreds of millions of dollars each year for higher octane gas than their cars need.' where description = 'The recommended gasoline for most cars is regular octane';
Update questions set explanation = 'The "Rule of 72" tell you how long it will take to double your money. To use the "Rule of 72," divide 72 by the interest rate you’re getting. For example, if you deposit $3,000 into an account with a 2% interest rate, divide 72 by two.
